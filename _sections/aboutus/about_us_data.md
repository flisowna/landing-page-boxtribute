title_of_the_story: Our Story
paragraph_s_group_intro:
- paragraph_for_the_intro: We founded Boxtribute to solve the problems we saw as volunteers
    and aid workers in the field.
- paragraph_for_the_intro: Our story begins in autumn 2016, at the height of the European
    refugee crisis, in a camp in Northern Greece.

  paragraph_s_group:
  - paragraph: We volunteered with a Norwegian NGO to distribute donations such as
      clothes, hygiene products and food to refugees. The lack of adapted tools and
      the chaotic situation in the field led us to rethink the logistics of humanitarian
      associations, Boxtribute was born.
  - paragraph: The web-app is designed to facilitate the distribution of essential
      goods in the field. A free shop was opened where all beneficiaries could have
      the same fair choice. Volunteers knew what items were available and where.

  paragraph_s_group:
  - paragraph: Coordinators gave out virtual currency and tracked what was bought
      with it. The shop changed how volunteers and refugees interacted - it became
      a place where everyone liked to go.
  - paragraph: This great success has encouraged us to support other associations
      through our application but also to refocus our humanitarian action on re-dignifying
      the beneficiaries. In 2019 Boxtribute was registered as a Dutch foundation under
      the legal name Stichting Boxwise.

  paragraph_s_group:
  - paragraph: Our team of former field coordinators, our experience as a foundation,
      and our regular collaboration with partner on the ground has shown us the shortcomings
      of the humanitarian system, and pushed us to rethink our commitment.
  - paragraph: "Nowadays we cooperate with more than 15 associations in Europe and
      in the Middle East. \nOur partners are engaged to support refugees and vulnerable
      population, by providing them clothes, healthcare, hygiene good, electronics
      etc."
