text: We volunteered with a Norwegian NGO to distribute donations such as clothes,
  hygiene products and food to refugees. The lack of adapted tools and the chaotic

  goods in the field. A free shop was opened where all beneficiaries could have the
  same fair choice. Volunteers knew what items were available and where.
