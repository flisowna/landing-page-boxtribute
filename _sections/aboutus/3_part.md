  East. \nOur partners are engaged to support refugees and vulnerable population,
  by providing them clothes, healthcare, hygiene good, electronics etc. \nOur team
  of former field coordinators, our experience as a foundation, and our regular collaboration
  with partner on the ground has shown us the shortcomings of the humanitarian system,
  and pushed us to rethink our commitment. "
