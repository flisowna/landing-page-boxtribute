  title: Our Story
  text_1: We founded Boxtribute to solve the problems we saw as volunteers and aid workers in the field.
  text_2: Our story begins in autumn 2016, at the height of the European refugee crisis,
  in a camp in Northern Greece.

  - part_1:
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: We volunteered with a Norwegian NGO to distribute donations such as clothes,
    hygiene products and food to refugees. The lack of adapted tools and the chaotic
    situation in the field led us to rethink the logistics of humanitarian associations,
    Boxtribute was born.

    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: 'Coordinators gave out virtual currency and tracked what was bought with
    it. The shop changed how volunteers and refugees interacted - it became a place
    where everyone liked to go. '
      - paragraph: 'This great success has encouraged us to support other associations through
    our application but also to refocus our humanitarian action on re-dignifying the
    beneficiaries. In 2019 Boxtribute was registered as a Dutch foundation under the
    legal name Stichting Boxwise. '

    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: "Nowadays we cooperate with more than 15 associations in Europe and in
          the Middle East. \nOur partners are engaged to support refugees and vulnerable
          population, by providing them clothes, healthcare, hygiene good, electronics etc.
          \n"
      - paragraph: Our team of former field coordinators, our experience as a foundation,
          and our regular collaboration with partner on the ground has shown us the shortcomings
          of the humanitarian system, and pushed us to rethink our commitment.
