title_for_the_team_section: Meet the Team
text_for_team_section: "**We are a diverse** team of people from around the world
  brought together by a belief that we can and should use our skills to make a positive
  impact in the world. Boxtribute combines knowledge we’ve honed for years in the
  startup, technology, and logistics sectors with our experiences of what is needed
  on the ground. It’s a solution we are proud to stand behind.   \n  \nAt **Boxtribute**,
  we ensure that our volunteers always have time to develop skills and explore new
  interests, as well as making sure everybody gets enough time off to relax!"
text_block_3: "**Our team of former field coord**inators, our experience as a foundation,
  and our regular collaboration with partner on the ground has shown us the shortcom-ings
  of the humanitarian system, and pushed us to rethink our commitment."
text_block_2: |-
  **Coordinators gave out vir**tual currency and tracked what was bought with it. The shop changed how volunteers and refugees interacted - it became a place where everyone liked to go.

  This great success has encouraged us to support other associations through our application but also to refocus our humanitarian action on re-dignifying the beneficiaries. In 2019 Boxtribute was registered as a Dutch foundation under the legal name Stichting Boxwise.

  # Test

  We volunteered with a Norwegian NGO to distribute donations such as clothes, hygiene products and food to refugees. The lac**k of adapted tools and the chaotic situation in the field led us to rethink the logistics of humanitarian associations.**

  paragraph_s_group:
  - paragraph: Boxtribute was born. The web-app is designed to facilitate the distribution
      of essential goods in the field. A free shop was opened where all beneficia-ries
      could have the same fair choice. Volunteers knew what items were available and
      where.
