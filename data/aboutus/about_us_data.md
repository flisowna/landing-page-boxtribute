title_of_the_story: Our Story
title_for_the_team_section: Meet the Team
text_for_team_section: "**We are a diverse** team of people from around the world
  brought together by a belief that we can and should use our skills to make a positive
  impact in the world. Boxtribute combines knowledge we’ve honed for years in the
  startup, technology, and logistics sectors with our experiences of what is needed
  on the ground. It’s a solution we are proud to stand behind.   \n  \nAt **Boxtribute**,
  we ensure that our volunteers always have time to develop skills and explore new
  interests, as well as making sure everybody gets enough time off to relax!"
text_block_3: Our team of former field coordinators, our experience as a foundation,
  and our regular collaboration with partner on the ground has shown us the shortcom-ings
  of the humanitarian system, and pushed us to rethink our commitment.
text_block_2: "Coordinators gave out virtual currency and tracked what was bought
  with it. The shop changed how volunteers and refugees interacted - it became a place
  where everyone liked to go.   \n   \nThis great success has encouraged us to support
  other associations through our application but also to refocus our humanitarian
  action on re-dignifying the beneficiaries. In 2019 Boxtribute was registered as
  a Dutch foundation under the legal name Stichting Boxwise."

text_block_1: We volunteered with a Norwegian NGO to distribute donations such as
  clothes, hygiene products and food to refugees. The lac**k of adapted tools and
  the chaotic situation in the field led us to rethink the logistics of humanitarian
  associations.**

  paragraph_s_group:
  - paragraph: Boxtribute was born. The web-app is designed to facilitate the distribution
      of essential goods in the field. A free shop was opened where all beneficia-ries
      could have the same fair choice. Volunteers knew what items were available and
      where.
