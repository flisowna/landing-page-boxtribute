  Our purpose is to make a real difference for vulnerable people by addressing the fundamental issues that prevent humanitarian aid from effectively aiding those in need today.

  Boxtribute empowers everyday people to run large-scale cooperative relief operations. \[Based on the challenges we faced doing relief work at the local grassroots level, we use technology - simplified - to cut through the “fog of humanitarian aid”.
