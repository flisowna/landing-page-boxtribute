text: Sea-Eye is a civil rescue NGO working in the Mediterranean Sea and has been
  active since 2015. With the rescue organisation, Sophie assisted people on the move
  as a Rhib communicator, which essentially means she was the first point of contact
  with the boat in distress, helping to calm and control the situation.
